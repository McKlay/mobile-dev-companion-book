## ðŸŸ¢ Part II: Getting Started with Your First Project

This second part of the book transitions from theory to practice. Here, youâ€™ll scaffold your very first React Native app using Expo, understand the project structure, and begin experimenting with styling through Tailwind (via NativeWind). By the end of this part, youâ€™ll have a running mobile app on both your device and the web, along with a clear grasp of the development feedback loop.

### Chapter 3: Scaffolding a React Native App

This chapter introduces `create-expo-app`, the official command-line tool for quickly bootstrapping a new project. Youâ€™ll learn how the project is generated, what each folder/file means, and how the setup compares to familiar web tooling like CRA or Vite. Finally, weâ€™ll walk through adding Tailwind with NativeWind for rapid UI development.

**Key points covered:**

* Using `create-expo-app` to bootstrap a project.  
* Explaining the generated project structure.  
* Adding TailwindCSS styling with NativeWind.  

### Chapter 4: Running Your App on Web and Device

Once your app is scaffolded, the next step is seeing it in action. This chapter explains how Expoâ€™s development server enables fast iteration with **Fast Refresh** and **Live Reload**. Youâ€™ll run your app in the browser, test it on a physical device via Expo Go, and learn when itâ€™s time to move to a custom Dev Client.

**Key points covered:**

* Fast Refresh & Live Reload basics.  
* Running your app on a physical device with Expo Go.  
* Deciding when to switch to a Dev Client for testing.

By the end of Part II, readers will have gone from zero to a functioning React Native project. Theyâ€™ll understand the projectâ€™s structure, have styling utilities in place, and be confident in running the app across devices. This foundation sets up the more advanced problem-solving lessons in Part III.
